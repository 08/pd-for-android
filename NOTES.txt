* You'll probably need to adjust the path for ndk-build in jni/Makefile.

* The current version of PdAndroidTest expects to find pd patches in /sdcard.
  Some sample patches are in /assets.

* If you experience audio glitches, play with the parameters in
  res/values/audio.xml.

* The Java bindings for pd do not depend on Android.  Just compile a shared
  library with -DUSEAPI_JAVA and -DJAVA.  The files in src/org/puredata that
  do not have "Android" in their name form the Java side of the bindings.
